# MyBambu IMT TRUE Economics Analysis
## October 2025 - CORRECTED FX SPREAD & RAIL COSTS

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current State:** The IMT (International Money Transfer) product is **PROFITABLE with a +$266,149 monthly margin** (50.5% margin) with a **25.4% monthly churn rate**.

**Critical Discovery:**
- **FX Spread was 1.5%, not 0.75%** - This doubles FX revenue to $309K/month
- **Rail costs from Spectrum Exhibit A** - Actual costs are $261K/month (not $412K)
- **Transaction fees barely cover rail costs** - The FX spread is the profit engine

**The Real Problem:**
- **25.4% churn rate** limits growth and customer lifetime value
- Customer lifetime is only **3.9 months**
- **Customer LTV margin of $36.70** limits CAC to ~$11
- This prevents aggressive growth and marketing spend

**Recommended Strategy:**
- **FOCUS ON RETENTION** - Reduce churn from 25% to <15%
- Optimize pricing for profitability while staying competitive
- Negotiate better rail costs where possible (especially Mexico)
- Expand high-margin corridors

**Expected Impact:** Reduce churn to 15% → Increase LTV from $36.70 to $70+ → Enable $20+ CAC for aggressive growth

```
Revenue:
  FX Revenue (1.5% × $20.6M)              $309,332  (58% of revenue)
  Bank Fees (28,541 × $0.85)               $24,260

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL REVENUE                           $527,395  (100%)

Costs:
  Rail Costs to Spectrum (by country)    -$261,246
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ✅ GROSS MARGIN                         $266,149  (50.5% margin!)
```

### Unit Economics

**Per Transaction:**
- Revenue: **$4.96**
- Rail Cost: **$2.46**
- **Gross Margin: $2.50** ✅

**Per Customer (Monthly):**
- Revenue: **$18.47**
- Rail Cost: **$9.15**
- **Gross Margin: $9.32** ✅

**Lifetime Value:**
- Customer Lifetime: **3.9 months** (25.4% churn)
- LTV Revenue: **$72.72**
- **LTV Margin: $36.70** ✅
- **Max Justifiable CAC: ~$11** (30% of LTV margin)

### Critical Insight: FX is the Profit Engine

**Revenue Breakdown:**
- FX Revenue: $309K (58% of revenue) → **Primary profit driver**
- Transaction Fees: $218K (42% of revenue) → Only covers 83% of rail costs

**The Business Model:**
- Transaction fees ($218K) < Rail costs ($261K) = **-$43K loss on fees**
- FX revenue ($309K) more than covers the gap = **Net +$266K margin**

**This means:** The business is profitable BECAUSE of FX spread, not transaction fees. Any pricing strategy must protect the FX revenue while optimizing transaction fees.

## 📉 CHURN & RETENTION CRISIS

### Monthly Churn Analysis
- **September Cohort:** 27,940 users
- **Retained in October:** 20,844 users (74.6%)
- **Churned:** 7,096 users (25.4%)

### 🔴 **MONTHLY CHURN RATE: 25.4%**

**What This Means:**
- Losing **1 in 4 customers every month**
- Average customer lifetime: **3.9 months**
- Need to acquire 7,096+ new users monthly just to maintain flat growth
- **LTV margin of only $36.70 limits CAC to ~$11**

### October User Breakdown
- 🆕 New Users: 3,193 (11.2%)
- 🔄 Returning Users: 25,358 (88.8%)

**⚠️ Red Flag:** New user acquisition (3,193) is less than half of churn (7,096)
- Net user loss: -3,903 users (-14%)
- **Product is shrinking, not growing**

### Why Churn is the Critical Problem

With current economics:
- Monthly margin per customer: $9.32
- Customer lifetime: 3.9 months
- **LTV margin: $36.70**
- Affordable CAC (30% of LTV): **$11**

If we reduce churn to 15%:
- Customer lifetime would increase to 6.7 months
- **LTV margin would increase to $62+**
- Affordable CAC would increase to **$18-20**
- This enables 80%+ increase in marketing budget!

| Honduras (HN) | 18,691 | $3.72M | 18.0% | $2.31 |
| Nicaragua (NI) | 16,171 | $3.72M | 18.0% | $2.62 |
| **Venezuela (VE)** | 12,496 | $0.91M | 4.4% | $1.77 |
| Colombia (CO) | 8,707 | $1.79M | 8.7% | $2.43 |

| Peru (PE) | 702 | $0.13M | 0.6% | $1.89 |

### Key Findings:

1. **Mexico is the largest corridor** (28% of transactions)
   - Best rail costs ($0.80 SPEI, $1.50 BBVA)
   - But margin per transaction ($2.35) is below average due to high cash mix

2. **Nicaragua has highest margin** ($2.62/txn)
   - Lower rail costs ($1.45 bank, $2.50 cash)
   - Good balance of bank vs cash payouts

3. **Venezuela is NOT in Spectrum contract** (12,496 txns!)
   - Using "OTHER" estimated costs ($2.50 bank, $3.00 cash)
   - Lower margin ($1.77/txn) - opportunity to negotiate better rates

4. **Payment Method Mix:**
   - Credit (cash pickup): 77,814 txns (73.1%) - Higher fees ($2.49)
   - Cash (bank deposit): 28,541 txns (26.8%) - Lower fees ($0.85)
   - Delivery: 54 txns (0.1%)

## 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: RETENTION FIRST (Most Important!)

**Goal:** Reduce churn from 25.4% to <15% in 3 months

**Why This Matters Most:**
- 15% churn = 6.7 month lifetime = $62+ LTV margin
- Enables $18-20 CAC (vs current $11)
- **80% increase in affordable marketing spend**
- Compounds growth through higher customer lifetime value

**Retention Tactics:**

**1. Win-Back Campaign** (Month 1)
- Target: 7,096 churned October users
- Offer: 1 free transaction (waive all fees)
- Cost: ~$15K
- Expected: 20% reactivation = 1,419 users back
- ROI: These users send 3+ txns over next 3 months = breakeven

**2. Loyalty Program** (Month 1-2)
- Tier 1 (Regular - 4+ txns/month): 0.1% FX discount
- Tier 2 (Frequent - 7+ txns/month): 0.2% FX discount + priority support
- Tier 3 (Power - 10+ txns/month): 0.3% FX discount + free express delivery
- Cost: ~$5K/month in discounts
- Impact: Reduce churn 25% → 18%

**3. Referral Program** (Month 2-3)
- Offer: $5 credit for referrer + $5 for new user
- Target: 5,000 referrals in Q1 2026
- Cost: $50K
- Expected Return: 5,000 users × $36.70 LTV = $183.5K
- **ROI: 267%**

**4. VIP Program for Power Users** (Month 2-3)
- Target: Top 10% users (2,855 users)
- Benefits: Dedicated support, 0.3% FX discount, instant transfers
- Goal: Increase retention from 75% to 90%
- Impact: Save 428 high-value users = $15.7K monthly margin saved

---

### Priority 2: OPTIMIZE PRICING (Secondary)

**Current State:**
- FX provides 58% of revenue and most of the margin
- Transaction fees barely cover rail costs (88% recovery)
- Mexico has high cash mix with expensive rail costs

**Options to Consider:**

**Option A: Increase Bank Fee (Conservative)**
- Change bank fee: $0.85 → $1.25
- Impact: +$11.4K monthly revenue
- Covers more of rail cost gap
- Still below market ($1.50-$2.00 typical)

**Option B: Optimize Mexico SPEI Mix**
- Push more Mexico transactions to SPEI ($0.80 rail cost vs $2.75 cash)
- Incentivize bank deposits over cash pickup
- Could save $1.95 per transaction switched

**Option C: Keep Pricing, Focus on Volume**
- Current margins (50.5%) are healthy
- Focus on retention and growth instead of price increases
- Avoid customer backlash during retention push

**Recommendation:** **Option C** - Don't change pricing during retention campaign. Current margins are strong. Focus all energy on reducing churn.

---

### Priority 3: NEGOTIATE RAIL COSTS (Opportunistic)

**Current Situation:**
- Paying Spectrum $261K/month in rail costs
- Total volume: $20.6M/month ($247M annual)
- Mix of tiered pricing by country and volume

**Negotiation Opportunities:**

**1. Mexico Volume Bonus** (Biggest Impact)
- Current: 28,014 Mexico txns/month
- Spectrum charges: $2.75 cash, $0.80-$1.50 bank
- Ask: Volume discount for exceeding 25K Mexico txns
- Target: 5-10% discount = $6-12K monthly savings

**2. Venezuela Addition to Contract**
- Currently: 12,496 txns using "OTHER" estimated costs
- Opportunity: Add Venezuela to Spectrum contract
- Target rate: $2.00 bank, $2.50 cash
- Savings: ~$6K/month if better than current

**3. Bundle Discount**
- Total across all countries: 106K+ txns/month
- Ask for portfolio discount for volume commitment
- Target: 3-5% across all countries = $8-13K monthly savings

**Total Potential Savings: $20-31K/month**

**Approach:**
- Don't negotiate immediately - wait 60 days
- Build case with 2-3 months of volume data
- Show growth trajectory from retention efforts
- Use as leverage: "We're growing, give us better rates or we'll explore alternatives"

---

### Priority 4: EXPAND HIGH-MARGIN CORRIDORS (Growth)

**Best Corridors by Margin:**
1. Nicaragua: $2.62/txn margin
2. Colombia: $2.43/txn margin
3. Mexico: $2.35/txn margin
4. Honduras: $2.31/txn margin

**Growth Strategy:**
- **Geographic marketing:** Target cities with high Nicaragua, Colombia, Honduras diaspora
- **Community partnerships:** Churches, cultural centers, remittance hotspots
- **Referral incentives:** Double referral bonus ($10+$10) for these corridors

**Expected Impact:**
- If we can shift 10% of volume to higher-margin corridors
- Additional margin: ~$5-8K/month

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Retention Campaigns Don't Work
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- A/B test all campaigns before full launch
- Start with small cohorts (500-1,000 users)
- Test multiple offer types (free txn, discount, credit)
- Conduct exit surveys to understand true churn drivers
- Have 3-4 backup tactics ready

**Monitoring:**
- Track weekly churn rate
- Measure campaign engagement daily
- Survey non-responders

**Contingency:**
- If churn doesn't improve after 30 days, pivot to price increases
- Consider more aggressive incentives ($10+ credits)
- Explore product improvements (faster processing, better UX)

---

### Risk 2: Retention Costs Exceed Benefits
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Set strict ROI targets for each campaign (>200% ROI)
- Cap spending at $70K for Q1
- Measure incrementality (did they really return because of offer?)
- Track long-term value of reactivated users

**Monitoring:**
- Calculate cost per reactivated user
- Track 30-day, 60-day, 90-day retention of reactivated users
- Compare to organic retention rates

**Contingency:**
- Cut underperforming campaigns after 14 days
- Reallocate budget to winning tactics
- Focus on zero-cost retention (product improvements, better UX)

---

### Risk 3: Competitors Respond with Price Wars
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor competitor pricing weekly
- Differentiate on speed, reliability, customer service (not just price)
- Build switching costs through loyalty program
- Focus on underserved corridors (Nicaragua, Honduras)

**Monitoring:**
- Track competitor rates for top 5 corridors
- Survey churned users about why they left
- Monitor market share trends

**Contingency:**
- If competitors undercut significantly, offer price match guarantee
- Create premium service tier for high-value customers
- Expand to corridors where competitors are weak

---

### Risk 4: Mexico Rail Costs Increase
**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Lock in current Spectrum rates through contract renewal
- Develop relationships with 2-3 alternative rail providers
- Push more Mexico volume to low-cost SPEI ($0.80 vs $2.75)
- Consider Mexico as separate business unit

**Monitoring:**
- Track Mexico margin per transaction monthly
- Monitor Spectrum contract renewal timeline
- Test alternative rails in small volume

**Contingency:**
- If Mexico rail costs rise >10%, increase customer fees
- Shift marketing to higher-margin corridors
- Negotiate exclusive volume commitments for better rates

---

### Risk 5: Churn is Structural, Not Solvable
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Very High

**Mitigation:**
- Understand true churn drivers through research
- Segment churn by customer type (one-time vs power users)
- Test extreme interventions (50% discount for 3 months)
- Explore product pivots if needed

**Monitoring:**
- Churn reasons by segment
- Cohort retention curves
- Win-back attempt success rates

**Contingency:**
- If 25% churn is unavoidable, adjust business model:
  - Increase prices to compensate for low LTV
  - Focus on one-time transactions (optimize for volume, not retention)
  - Pivot to B2B remittances (businesses have lower churn)
