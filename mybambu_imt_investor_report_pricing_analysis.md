## Customer Lifetime Value Impact

### LTV Calculation Methodology

**Assumptions:**
- Monthly Churn Rate: 25.4%
- Average Customer Lifetime: 3.9 months
- Average Transactions per Customer: 3.79

### LTV Comparison

| Metric | Current Pricing | Proposed Pricing | Change |
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **Margin per Transaction** | $0.61 | $4.24 | +$3.62 |
| **× Avg Txns per Customer** | × 3.79 | × 3.79 | |
| **= Monthly Margin per Customer** | $2.32 | $16.05 | +$13.74 |
| **× Average Lifetime (months)** | × 3.9 | × 3.9 | |
| **= Customer LTV (Margin)** | **$9.11** | **$63.19** | **+$54.08 (+593%)** |

### Affordable Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Using standard 30% LTV:CAC ratio:

| Metric | Current Pricing | Proposed Pricing | Change |
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **Customer LTV** | $9.11 | $63.19 | +$54.08 |
| **Affordable CAC (30%)** | $2.73 | $18.96 | +$16.22 |

**Strategic Implication:** With 7x higher affordable CAC, we can significantly increase marketing spend to drive customer acquisition and still maintain healthy unit economics.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Customer Churn

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Probability:** 30-40% of one-time users may not return

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Grandfathering:** Offer existing power users (10+ txns) 60-day grace period with old pricing
2. **Loyalty Program:** Launch VIP program for power users with discounted pricing
3. **First-Time User Promotion:** Keep promotional pricing for first 3 transactions to acquire users
4. **Value Communication:** Emphasize service improvements, speed, and reliability

**Expected Impact:** Limit churn increase to <5 percentage points (from 25.4% to <30.4%)

---

### Risk 2: Competitive Response

**Risk Level:** Low
**Probability:** 20% - competitors may reduce prices

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Market Monitoring:** Track competitor pricing weekly
2. **Price Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust FX spread if needed
3. **Value Differentiation:** Emphasize superior UX, speed, and customer service
4. **Corridor-Specific Pricing:** Maintain flexibility to price competitively in key corridors

**Expected Impact:** Our proposed pricing remains below most competitors; we have room to adjust

---

### Risk 3: Volume Decline

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Probability:** 15-25% potential volume decline in first 60 days

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Increased Marketing:** Use higher CAC threshold ($18.96 vs $2.73) to drive acquisition
2. **Referral Program:** Launch aggressive referral incentives
3. **Promotional Campaigns:** Seasonal offers to drive volume
4. **Corridor Expansion:** Enter new high-margin corridors

**Expected Impact:** Volume may decline 10-15% initially but recover within 90 days with increased marketing

**Break-Even Analysis:**

| Scenario | Volume Change | Revenue | Margin |
|----------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Current (100% volume)** | 0% | $326,867 | $65,006 (19.9%) |
| **Proposed (100% volume)** | 0% | $712,567 | $450,706 (63.3%) |
| **Proposed (85% volume)** | -15% | $605,682 | $383,228 (63.3%) |
| **Proposed (75% volume)** | -25% | $534,425 | $337,569 (63.3%) |
| **Proposed (60% volume)** | -40% | $427,540 | $293,584 (68.7%) |

**Key Insight:** Even with a 40% volume decline, we would still generate **$293K monthly margin** - 4.5x current levels. We can afford significant volume loss and remain highly profitable.

---

### Risk 4: Regulatory/Compliance

**Risk Level:** Low
**Probability:** <5%

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Legal Review:** Ensure pricing complies with all regulations
2. **Disclosure:** Transparent pricing shown before transaction confirmation
3. **Terms Update:** Update terms of service with 30-day notice

**Expected Impact:** Minimal - pricing changes are standard business practice
